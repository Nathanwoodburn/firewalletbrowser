Project summary
A Handshake wallet web ui. This will be a HSD wallet web ui that will allow users to manage their Handshake domains via a web interface. This will allow users to easily manage their domains without having to use the command line or bob. One benefit of this is that it will allow users to easily manage their domains from their mobile devices that don't have access to any HNS wallet. This could be done in a secure way by only allowing connections on local network devices (in addition to requiring the wallet credentials).

Features:
- Login with HSD wallet name + password (by default don't show a list of wallets to login to as this could be a security risk)
- View account information in a dashboard
  - Available balance
  - Total balance
  - Pending Transactions
  - List of domains
  - List of transactions
- Manage domains
  - Transfer domains
  - Finalize domains
  - Edit domains
  - Revoke domains (with a warning and requiring the account password)
- Manage wallet
  - Send HNS
  - Receive HNS
- Auctions
  - View bids on domain
  - Open auction
  - Bid on auction
  - Reveal bid
  - Redeem bid
  - Register domain

Completion requirements:
- Basic functionality including
   - View info
   - Send/Receive HNS
   - Manage domains

After the initial version is completed I will be looking to add more features including the above mentioned features.


The initial version will be completed in 2-3 weeks with a fully fledged version released later as the features are developed and tested.
